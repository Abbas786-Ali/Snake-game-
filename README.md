Snake Game

Overview

The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where players control a snake that grows longer as it consumes food. The objective is to score as many points as possible by eating the food while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.

How It Works

Game Mechanics:

1. Initialization:

The game starts with a snake of a fixed initial length placed at the center of the game grid.

A piece of food is randomly generated on the grid.



2. Snake Movement:

The snake moves continuously in one of four directions (up, down, left, right).

The player controls the direction of the snake using keyboard arrow keys or other input methods.



3. Food Consumption:

When the snake’s head collides with the food, the following happens:

The snake grows longer by one unit.

The player’s score increases.

A new piece of food is randomly generated on the grid.




4. Collision Detection:

The game checks for collisions in every frame:

Wall Collision: If the snake’s head touches the boundary of the grid, the game ends.

Self-Collision: If the snake’s head touches its own body, the game ends.




5. Game Over:

When a collision occurs, the game stops, and the final score is displayed.



6. Score Tracking:

The score increases with each piece of food consumed.

Optionally, the highest score achieved is stored and displayed.




Features:

Adjustable snake speed for different difficulty levels.

Randomized food placement, ensuring it doesn’t appear on the snake's body.

Clean and simple user interface.

Optional sound effects and animations for enhanced gameplay.
